To fix this issue and ensure even spacing regardless of the item's width, you need to change the `justify-content` property to `space-around`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

Alternatively, you could use a different layout method such as grid, which makes achieving even spacing easier.
