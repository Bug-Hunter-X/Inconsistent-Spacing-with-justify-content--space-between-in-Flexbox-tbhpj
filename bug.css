The following CSS code snippet has a common error that can be difficult to detect:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

This code intends to create three items that are spaced evenly within a flex container. However, if you run this code, the result might not be what you expect. The flex items might not be evenly spaced.
